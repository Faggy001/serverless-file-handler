**TOPIC**: Build a Complete Serverless Application using AWS Lambda


üìÑ **Serverless File Upload App ‚Äì Scaling and Failure Handling Summary**

This project is a simple but powerful serverless application built with AWS services. The idea is straightforward: when a user uploads a file to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function is triggered. That function logs the file‚Äôs metadata to DynamoDB and notifies a user via email using SNS.

Below is an overview of how this app scales to handle larger loads and how it deals with errors when things don‚Äôt go as planned.

‚öôÔ∏è **How the App Works**

Here‚Äôs what happens behind the scenes:

A file is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.

S3 triggers a Lambda function automatically.

The Lambda function:

Reads file info (like the name and time of upload)

Saves that info into a DynamoDB table

Publishes a message to an SNS topic

SNS sends an email notification to the user.

CloudWatch logs everything and helps with monitoring or debugging if something goes wrong.

üìà **How the App Scales**

One of the best parts of this design is that it‚Äôs built entirely on serverless, managed services ‚Äî which means AWS takes care of all the scaling for you.

**S3**

Amazon S3 can handle a huge number of file uploads per second.

It scales automatically and reliably, with very high availability.

**Lambda**

AWS Lambda spins up as many copies as needed ‚Äî one per event.

This means if 1,000 files are uploaded at once, Lambda can process them in parallel (within service limits).

You don‚Äôt need to configure or manage any servers.

**DynamoDB**

The table uses on-demand capacity, so it scales up (and down) based on how many write requests it gets.

It‚Äôs highly performant, even under heavy traffic.

**SNS**

Amazon SNS can fan out messages to multiple subscribers, instantly.

It‚Äôs a good fit for alerting because it can send messages in near real time, even under large bursts.

**CloudWatch**

All logs and metrics are captured automatically.

You can scale monitoring and create alarms without worrying about infrastructure.

üõ° **How It Handles Failures**

Things go wrong. That‚Äôs expected. This app is designed to handle common failures gracefully:

**Lambda Errors**

The Lambda function wraps its logic in a try/except block.

If something fails (like DynamoDB being unavailable), it logs the error to CloudWatch.

AWS can also automatically retry the Lambda (for some triggers).

**DynamoDB**

DynamoDB is reliable, but if a write fails, the error is caught and logged.

This can later be routed to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) or retried manually.

**SNS Delivery Issues**

For email delivery, SNS tries for a while, but eventually drops undeliverable messages.

If your email subscription isn‚Äôt confirmed, you won‚Äôt receive alerts ‚Äî but the Lambda will log that failure.

**S3 Event Duplication**

S3 guarantees at-least-once delivery, so your Lambda might get the same event more than once.

It‚Äôs best to make your Lambda function idempotent ‚Äî meaning it won‚Äôt break if it processes the same file twice.

**Logging and Alerts**

Everything that happens (or fails) is logged to CloudWatch Logs.

You can set up CloudWatch Alarms to get notified if, say, the Lambda function fails multiple times in a row.

**Security and Isolation**

IAM Roles follow least privilege:

Lambda only has access to S3 read, DynamoDB write, SNS publish.

Environment variables securely pass table/topic names.

No hard-coded secrets.
